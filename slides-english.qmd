**Death by PowerPoint (noun):**

A painful experience caused by a long, boring presentation with too many slides filled with text, small fonts, and endless bullet points. Common symptoms include sleepy eyes, yawning, and a strong desire to escape. 

Example: "After an hour, I felt like I was dying by PowerPoint."

:::{.notes}
Storytelling is older than movies and books. People has been telling stories since the begining, because it's just the way our brains work. Just as biology can explain why triple chocolate cakes are imposible to resist to our bellies, our brains crave stories. Stories have a structure that makes easy for the brain to remember. Good stories are easy to remember. Every one of you could probably tell the main structure of at least 10 stories: little red riding houd, cindirella, dune, star wars, harry potter, etc. 
You didn't have to study the structure. It's just natural to remember it.

:::{.notes}
There is a known psycology effect. You remember something:
How it ended
What was the most intense emotion
This is key. Always build your presentation around the big ending you want. Work backwards. Create the five ending slides. If anything goes bad, you could still present only those 5 slides. Make sure that’s the ending you want and your audience deserves. Only then work backwards to the rest of the presentation.
The peak–end rule is a psychological heuristic in which people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (i.e., its most intense point) and at its end, rather than based on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.
This is why we don't remember the queue of the rollercoaster, and do remmeber the thrill!

We are only as good as our communication skills. If you’re really really good, the god of anything, but cannot articulate your ideas and communicate effectively, you’ll only be as good as some bad with great communication skills. Don’t make the mistake. Learn to communicate effectively. [Visual of a lake? A multiplication? A lever!] Public speaking is a lever.
Think of Sherlock Holmes. We can admire his prodigious mind and memory only because of the work of Doctor John Watson. It’s not enough to crack the case and solve the mystery. We need to be able to collect the important facts and to tell an engaging story. Same goes for data science. It’s not enough to know the latest library or model the problem properly, it’s all about distilling the important fact that your boss needs to know to make the important decisions.

You as presenter should be like a magician. You have to firmly grip the attention and redirect it where you want them to look, without them feel manipulated. It’s quite hard. But that’s why good visualizations are the most powerful tool.

Quarto is a well established project from . It allows to create an equivalent to jupyter notebook, but only with markdown, so the files and repos are clean and easy to maintain. The files have extension qmd, and you can create pretty much anything. Books, websites, etc. It’s quite incredible. This presentation has been made in quarto, BTW. For presentations, the configuration file takes care of converting the plain qmd files into a html page with the revealjs library, which as you have seen is highly editable. But, it’s just a website. So you can share it around and people should be able to open it without to much trouble - or convert it to pdf.

:::{.notes}
I think Data Storytelling will be huge in the next years.
We are on the begining of a new type of professionals, just as Data Scientists were 8 years ago.
For me, Data Storytelling sits at the intersection of Public Speaking, Visualization and Storytelling. It’s learning a bit of these 3 fields, to make your presentations and talks more interesting, more meaningful and more memorable.  Data Storytelling is creating presentations that present data insights in a way that’s easier to understand, digest and actionable.
