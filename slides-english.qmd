Stories are older than all of our technology
:::
:::

:::{.notes}
Storytelling is older than movies and books. People has been telling stories since the begining, because it's just the way our brains work. Just as biology can explain why triple chocolate cakes are imposible to resist to our bellies, our brains crave stories. Stories have a structure that makes easy for the brain to remember. Good stories are easy to remember. Every one of you could probably tell the main structure of at least 10 stories: little red riding houd, cindirella, dune, star wars, harry potter, etc. 
You didn't have to study the structure. It's just natural to remember it.

:::{.notes}
There is a known psycology effect. You remember something:
How it ended
What was the most intense emotion
This is key. Always build your presentation around the big ending you want. Work backwards. Create the five ending slides. If anything goes bad, you could still present only those 5 slides. Make sure that’s the ending you want and your audience deserves. Only then work backwards to the rest of the presentation.
The peak–end rule is a psychological heuristic in which people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (i.e., its most intense point) and at its end, rather than based on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.
This is why we don't remember the queue of the rollercoaster, and do remmeber the thrill!

We are only as good as our communication skills. If you’re really really good, the god of anything, but cannot articulate your ideas and communicate effectively, you’ll only be as good as some bad with great communication skills. Don’t make the mistake. Learn to communicate effectively. [Visual of a lake? A multiplication? A lever!] Public speaking is a lever.
Think of Sherlock Holmes. We can admire his prodigious mind and memory only because of the work of Doctor John Watson. It’s not enough to crack the case and solve the mystery. We need to be able to collect the important facts and to tell an engaging story. Same goes for data science. It’s not enough to know the latest library or model the problem properly, it’s all about distilling the important fact that your boss needs to know to make the important decisions.

You as presenter should be like a magician. You have to firmly grip the attention and redirect it where you want them to look, without them feel manipulated. It’s quite hard. But that’s why good visualizations are the most powerful tool.
There is a good amount of visualization libraries.

This would be the equivalent to do the footwork of hearing people stories.

Finally, the hardest part of Storytelling. Stories are like puzzles. A solved puzzle is easy to check for correctness, but it takes a long time to be solved.  We intuitively recognize when we hear a good story. But crafting a story is really really hard. The good part: there are some structures to be used and usually your intuition is good enough. It’s a skill that can be learned. So let’s try to learn a thing or two on Data Storytelling. Or maybe a better analogy is that Storytelling is like cooking. Eating is easy. Preparing an outstanding meal is hard.

Stories are simple

. . .

start, conflict, ending.
:::

:::{.notes}
One of the secrets of Storytelling is that all stories have “The hero´s journey” - something studied by Joseph? Campbel on the ??, which sort of says that there is a common structure: normal world - conflict and call to adventure - … - resolution - return the normal world. Why should you care about this?
This structure, this pattern, works. It’s engaging and the brain cannot avoid caring about the end. It creates an open loop, and people want to closure. It’s a pattern that works. If you have to remember only 1 thing from this talk, remember this: The audience for your presentation, treat each one of them as a hero on their own. They have their own inner world, and your presentation disrupts that world. You share with them a knowledge, something that SHOULD change how they see the world, the tools they have, anything. At least one phrase to be remembered. If nothing changes for the audience, they wont remember anything a couple of days or even hours after your talk. Memory is very selective. That’s why brains evolved to like stories.
Now, how to connect this to python and tools?

Quarto is a well established project from . It allows to create an equivalent to jupyter notebook, but only with markdown, so the files and repos are clean and easy to maintain. The files have extension qmd, and you can create pretty much anything. Books, websites, etc. It’s quite incredible. This presentation has been made in quarto, BTW. For presentations, the configuration file takes care of converting the plain qmd files into a html page with the revealjs library, which as you have seen is highly editable. But, it’s just a website. So you can share it around and people should be able to open it without to much trouble - or convert it to pdf.

:::{.notes}
I think Data Storytelling will be huge in the next years.
We are on the begining of a new type of professionals, just as Data Scientists were 8 years ago.
For me, Data Storytelling sits at the intersection of Public Speaking, Visualization and Storytelling. It’s learning a bit of these 3 fields, to make your presentations and talks more interesting, more meaningful and more memorable.  Data Storytelling is creating presentations that present data insights in a way that’s easier to understand, digest and actionable.
